"""Surgical writer for the shared, hand-editable ``config.toml``.

``config.toml`` has two kinds of author: a person with an editor, and the
desktop settings panel. That makes byte preservation a hard requirement rather
than a nicety -- the first time a UI click reflows someone's comments and
spacing, the file stops being theirs. So this writes like ``secrets.py`` writes
``.env``: read, replace the one line that owns the setting, write the rest back
untouched.

Deliberately limited to scalar values. Rewriting an array (``[pools]``) means
re-serializing a container, which is where a line-based editor would start
losing the user's line breaks and inline comments -- so it refuses instead of
corrupting, and the day a pool-selection UI needs it, that is the moment to
bring in a round-trip TOML library rather than to extend this.

Stdlib only, on purpose. FineSub 0.5.0 removed this writer after the desktop
split because the CLI has no configuration-writing command. The desktop
settings panel still owns the behavior, so the migration keeps it here rather
than asking the upstream package to retain a desktop-only API.
